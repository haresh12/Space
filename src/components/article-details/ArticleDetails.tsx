              Jonathan Knowles Asteroid Ryugu Has Dust Grains Older Than the
              Sun. How? By: Paul M. Sutter In 2018 the Japanese space agency
              sent the Hayabusa2 mission to the asteroid Ryugu, As a part of
              that mission, the spacecraft blasted material off the surface of
              the asteroid, put it in a bottle, and sent it back to Earth. Two
              years later that sample landed in the western deserts of
              Australia.

          The second clue is that many of the chemicals found inside Ryugu
          feature water, which means that the asteroid once had a lot of water
          ice in its makeup. Again, if Ryugu formed too close to the Sun, the
          ice would have vaporized, leaving no water to find its way into
          various interesting chemical combinations.

          That retrieval contains the most pristine sample of a carbon-rich
          asteroid ever obtained. Immediately scientists began studying the
          material, using its chemical clues to help understand the history of
          our solar system. And now the preliminary results are in, and it looks
          like Ryugu might be older than the Sun itself.

          While astronomers had long suspected that asteroids like Ryugu formed
          far away from the Sun, there was no way to prove it until now, because
          any asteroid material that we would study had to first fall through
          our atmosphere at tens of thousands of miles per hour. This process
          alters the asteroids so much that itâ€™s difficult to tell what the
          asteroid was originally like. But with Ryugu, we finally got our hands
          on a clean sample.

        <span className=" text-gray-500 justify-center align-middle mt-2 leading-8 text-xl mx-4">
          All this means that Ryugu, and carbon-rich asteroids like it, formed
          from the swirling disk of material that surrounded the Sun before it
          ignited fusion reactions and became a star. In fact, Ryugu probably
          predates the formation of the planets itself. But shortly after it
          formed, it got a gravitational kick from Jupiter or Saturn, which sent
          it and all its friends into the asteroid belt, where it has remained
          for billions of years.
